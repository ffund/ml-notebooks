    "-   We practiced using exploratory data analysis as a first step toward identifying problems or wrong assumptions related to the data.\n",
    "-   We also saw that when using models with good *interpretability*, we can inspect the fitted model as another step toward finding problems with the data. For example, in a case study on linear regression, we saw that the coefficients for certain features were high when common sense dictated that those features should not have any effect on the target variable.\n",

    "**Find and correct a problem with the model implementation/training**:\n",

    "-   When there appears to be a pattern in the residuals, this indicates something “learnable” in the data that isn’t captured by our model.\n",
    "    -   For example, suppose we find that the residuals appear to be a function of $y$, but not of any feature $x$. This suggests that $y$ is partly a function of a “missing” feature, which we should try to identify (using domain knowledge) and add to our model.\n",
    "    -   Similarly, if the residuals appear to be a function of a feature $x$ that is in our data, but we are not using to train the model, we should absolutely add that feature to our model.\n",
    "-   Another thing to look for in a residuals plot: “outliers” or extreme values. These can sometimes indicate problems with the data,such as samples affected by measurement or recording error. (In this case, you might want to exclude these samples, and also figure out how to exclude them in production.) These can also indicate that the data is drawn from two distributions, where samples from the minority distribution appear as outliers. (In this case, you wouldn’t want to exclude these samples. You would want to add a feature to help you distinguish between the two populations, and then re-train your model with the added feature.)\n",
