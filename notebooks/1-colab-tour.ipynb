    "-   It provides free access to GPUs, which will be very helpful later in the course when we are working with neural networks. (There are some limits to this free access, however.)\n",
    "-   It has many of the most popular machine learning libraries already pre-installed, and you can manually install any other libraries you might need (for example, for your project).\n",
    "-   It is easy to share Colab notebooks with others.\n",
