    "\n",
    "-   COMPAS assigns scores from 1 (lowest risk) to 10 (highest risk).\n",
    "-   It also assigns a class: each sample is labeled as high risk of recidivism, medium risk of recidivism, or low risk of recidivism. For this analysis, we turn it into a binary classification problem by re-labeling as medium or high risk of recidivism vs. low risk of recidivism.\n",
    "-   As input, the model uses 137 factors, including age, gender, and criminal history of the defendant.\n",
