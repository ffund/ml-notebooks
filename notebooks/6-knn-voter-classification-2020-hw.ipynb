    "\n",
    "Exit polls are conducted by Edison Research on behalf of a consortium of media organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the member organizations decide what races to cover, what sample size they want, what questions should be asks, and other details. Then, sample precincts are selected, and local interviewers are hired and trained. Then, at those precincts, the local interviewer approaches a subset of voters as they exit the polls (for example, every third voter, or every fifth voter, depending on the required sample size).\n",
    "\n",
    "When a voter is approached, they are asked if they are willing to fill out a questionnaire. Typically about 40-50% agree. (For those that decline, the interviewer visually estimates their age, race, and gender, and notes this information, so that the response rate by demographic is known and responses can be weighted accordingly in order to be more representative of the population.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Voters that agree to participate are then given an form with 15-20 questions. They fill in the form (anonymously), fold it, and put it in a small ballot box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several times during the day, the interviewers will stop, take the questionnaires, compile the results, and call them in to the Edison Research phone center. The results are reported immediately to the media organizations that are consortium members.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the poll of in-person voters, absentee and early voters (who are not at the polls on Election Day) are surveyed by telephone."

(Our custom distance metric, which is an L1 distance, treats values that are *unknown* as if they are *similar* - neither one increases the distance.)
