In the article “Beauty in the Classroom: Professors’ Pulchritude and Putative Pedagogical Productivity” ([PDF](https://www.nber.org/papers/w9853.pdf)), authors Daniel Hamermesh and Amy M. Parker suggest (based on a data set of teaching evaluation scores collected at UT Austin) that student evaluation scores can partially be predicted by features unrelated to teaching, such as the physical attractiveness of the instructor.\n",
